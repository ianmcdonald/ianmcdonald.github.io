Last week while driving, I noticed a billboard a few blocks from my home. It was an advertisement for real estate services—with the predictably lacklustre design that one would except from such a thing—which would normally lay hidden in plain sight, but a misreading of the text on my part transfigured this particular billboard. What had at first glance appeared to be a subtle call to action, but one of unimaginable existential depth, was merely a marketing tagline whose value extended no further than its surface: Explore realty. After realizing my error, I couldn’t shake the misreading from my mind: Explore reality.

Coincidentally, predictions about virtual reality transforming the real estate market have been a topic of much discussion in the media over the last few months. Agents will be increasingly moving toward taking clients on virtual tours of properties as opposed to physical visitation, removing certain restraints that time and space insert into the real estate hunt. Prospective buyers can walk through—virtually—properties in other parts of their country, or the other side of the world. The door also opens for agents to give full remote tours of proposed or unfinished properties to their clients, tour a living space that doesn’t actually exist—yet.

"Reality includes everything that is and has been, whether or not it is observable or comprehensible. A still broader definition includes that which has existed, exists, or will exist."

### I.
Our senses feed us the input that we use to determine, if we trick or deceive our senses, how can we know what is real or unreal? Does it matter?

### II.
So what happens if a space that one tours, a space which feels familiar and real, never ends up being built. Does it not fulfill its reality? If the memory that a person has of a virtual space is no less real, no less vivid, no less emotionally communicative, did they step outside of reality for that moment? Does that particular memory exist separate from all others, disconnected from any real spaces they have entered? If the space does not exist during their life time, it is impossible to conclude definitively that it has never or will never exist—on a long enough timeline, statistical probability would suggest that that space, or one just like that which they have experienced will come to pass. If we account for our observable universe, one which science suggests is very much a part of our reality—or perhaps we are a part of its reality—we have to assume that if you were to search all possible spaces on all possible planets orbiting all possible stars in all possible galaxies, that space is quiet likely to exist at one point in time or another. It is, or was, or will be a reality.

### III.
Now, if we account for our memory, which is the only way we can examine something as real or unreal when not currently present in the moment. If reality is to only be something that actually exists, our memories are an imperfect copy of the space, we are not remembering the space as it actually existed, so our memory is one that exists outside of that reality, resting only in the comfort that somewhere and somewhen that space is a reality.

### IV.
Do we not also live in a reality that requires an elastic definition in our experiences online? Social networks portray someone not in terms of their physical, mental, emotional, spatial, and temporal qualities.
