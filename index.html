          <p>A designer, developer, and educator&mdash;teaching at Niagara College and creating artifacts for the World Wide Web. I conduct informal research around design, hypertext, and much more on <a href="https://are.na/ian-mcdonald/index">Are.na</a>, code in the open on <a href="https://github.com/ianmcdonald/">GitHub</a>, occasionally post on <a href="https://twitter.com/systemdefaults">Twitter</a>, and have been trying to write in my <a href="https://blog.ianmcdonald.ca">weblog</a> more often.</p>

          <p>I maintain an online <a href="https://teaching.ianmcdonald.ca/">teaching portal/archive</a> for my classes and will be documenting and writing about my personal teaching philosophy in the very near future, with tentative plans for an online newsletter to think about and document ideas surrounding design, technology, and pedagogical perspectives.</p>
